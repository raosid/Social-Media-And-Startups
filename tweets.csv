even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose because challenge requires sacrifice

even_ceo.json,it's quite possible i've done more work in the last month than in the rest of my career combined.
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose if you want a mean to learn something, teach him not. put him in a position to teach himself. probably closer.
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose @davecraige that's definitely bastardized from the smart ancient person who originally wrote it but you get the idea.
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose @davecraige the best way to teach a man is not to tell him so, but to put him in a position to learn it for himself
even_ceo.json,@artypapers the solution imo is pareto principle. 80% of the impact comes from 20% of ruthless interactions. be extremely nice other 80%
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose @davecraige step one: give no fucks
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose @davecraige i dont think words will do much. only success.
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose @davecraige i find helping people in a very direct way to be quite glamorous.

even_ceo.json,people often praise how fast we move given we're in finance. i find this funny. just because everyone else sucks does not mean we're good
even_ceo.json,@rabois @sean_a_rose which book? this one? http://t.co/CWYvz5zf0n
even_ceo.json,@rabois but there are fucking terrible books and immensely valuable essays that you can only find on "blogs"
even_ceo.json,@rabois they probably are magic in that they offer both length and depth where other mediums dont, so your heuristic is likely valid
even_ceo.json,@rabois yes, i read them yesterday. thx for ruining my saturday. they confirm that reading exercises the brain, not that books are magic.
even_ceo.json,@rabois I don't read blogs, I just find the premise absurd. I will read organized mind :)
even_ceo.json,@rabois lol
even_ceo.json,@rabois is it books, or voracious curiosity for knowledge and discipline that correlates with success?
even_ceo.json,@rabois I will flip on this in a heartbeat if someone shows me actual evidence of the medium impacting rate of development
even_ceo.json,@rabois this is like saying in 1830, every successful person I know works by candlelight. Skip the electricity
even_ceo.json,@rabois thx
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele in fact the hallmark of good 20th/21st c science is transcending the empirical process and instead relying on statistics
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele I do not think empirical means what you think it means. The sun revolving around the earth was an empirical conclusion.
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele additionally, most of the body is nonreplicated. See: https://t.co/kv00yeeBye
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele the research is not clear at all. I have read quite a bit of it.
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele I'll flip on this in a heartbeat if someone shows me actual evidence instead of playing the "this is well researched" card
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele and yet the last sentence of her first paragraph is "No one knows"
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele @rabois @sean_a_rose good questions but literally zero evidence in what you linked, but I will read her book
even_ceo.json,@BrianRoemmele @rabois @sean_a_rose this researcher's methodology is self report survey. validity so threatened Im surprised it's published
even_ceo.json,@rabois @sean_a_rose unclear to me how one can come to the conclusion that books are somehow a more effective medium for development
even_ceo.json,@rabois @sean_a_rose i've now read 24 neuropsych journal articles on the impacts of reading on cognitive development‚Äî
even_ceo.json,@rabois @sean_a_rose what is the exercise exactly
even_ceo.json,@rabois @sean_a_rose ...wat
even_ceo.json,@rabois @sean_a_rose why?
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose this is an interesting question actually, im not sure which i'd prefer
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose would you rather have people reading bad shit or no shit
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose aka most blog posts are shit but people read them as if they're not?
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose i think the reality is that 80% of everything is shit. many great blog posts better than most books, &amp; vice versa
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose is this right? seems most books dont understand the pareto principle
even_ceo.json,@bobby @littlenono hi
even_ceo.json,@littlenono correct, we would reject u
even_ceo.json,@sean_a_rose possibly depending on how tomorrow goes, will letchu know

even_ceo.json,@hellyeahdude the notion that the 80/20 of cash flow management is impulse control is simply not supported by data or evidence of any kind

even_ceo.json,@markbao in the western world, for sure. there are other reasons for its popularity‚Äîit is a good tool for allowing the viewer's brain to
even_ceo.json,@markbao 100% serious. this is also why whitespace is not universally considered "good design."
even_ceo.json,@markbao so printing less information on a page was a sign of wealth, and therefore considered desirable
even_ceo.json,@markbao it actually stems from printing days, where you paid by page and therefore people tried to fit as much information on a single page

even_ceo.json,I think the most important thing I've ever learned is how malleable our personalities are. Surround yourself with the right people.
even_ceo.json,@KillerMartinis All these tweets. It's almost like you should write a dope book or something.
even_ceo.json,@bobby yeah i unfavd that shit. mediocre joke

even_ceo.json,@RachelSchneider thank you Rachel!
even_ceo.json,@markbao call anytime.
even_ceo.json,@markbao yes please but now you are committed to having a call with me instead of an email. lemme lemme upgrade ya
even_ceo.json,@markbao i know ur lying because they are called Nickelback and a real Nickelbacker would know that not that i'm a real Nickelbacker shut up
even_ceo.json,@markbao at least you dont have to feed ur thing
even_ceo.json,@markbao all that shit for 20 bucks a month!!!!!!!
even_ceo.json,@markbao did u google lifelock to see the plans cause i just did googled lifelock to see the plans.
even_ceo.json,@markbao did u buy lifelock
even_ceo.json,@markbao is that a real challenge
even_ceo.json,@markbao if you dont email me i will just find new ways to annoy you via the internet
even_ceo.json,@markbao but yeah seriously email me so we can talk about Incentive structures and mismatched incentives because that is a baller topic.
even_ceo.json,@markbao aka LUV IT
even_ceo.json,@markbao btw i just looked at your website. your current interests are the nerdiest shit i have ever seen
even_ceo.json,@markbao seems legit
even_ceo.json,@markbao is that short for reggae week
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 he used different sources for the team data; some of the sources included special teams, others did not
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 @Slate yes but you eliminate special teams and the change you are talking about isn't supported by the data.
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 @Slate correlation != causation
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 @Slate see also: http://t.co/XizEm0POi5
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 @Slate the conversation here is pretty interesting: http://t.co/X1a7QK9geS
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 @Slate and if you remove brandon tate from the sample, it completely changes the aggregated statistics
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 @Slate most of the players they include in the sample fumbled ONCE with the patriots and TWICE with another team.
even_ceo.json,@BryanWolff01 @Slate i'll admit it does seem like brady is lying about something, but the data in that article is absolute garbage.
even_ceo.json,"Patriots are the Uber of the NFL" is a remarkably apt analogy.
even_ceo.json,new favorite adjective: jabroni-esque
even_ceo.json,@marceloeduardo that makes a lot of sense. thanks for sharing your experience, really helpful.
even_ceo.json,@marceloeduardo it seems unfair to unilaterally raise a red flag but after a while the opportunity cost adds up...

even_ceo.json,@aviflombaum @TheClayFox we actually talked to you guys this very morning! walked away impressed.
even_ceo.json,@bobby i'm honestly not making any commentary about dev bootcamps. i just want to know if they make people who can do things.
even_ceo.json,@crhoton depends how you define senior i guess. "can jump right in and ship shit" is how i'd define it. and judging by angelist, they do
even_ceo.json,@crhoton what made you want to go to a bootcamp?
even_ceo.json,@crhoton that makes sense.
even_ceo.json,@libbybrittain clearly this is a sensitive subject but really what i'm asking is "how experienced are people coming out of these bootcamps"
even_ceo.json,@libbybrittain i see your point, but i dont think the analogy is valid. i wouldn't hire someone out of any college for a senior position.
even_ceo.json,@aviflombaum @TheClayFox seems unfairly vitriolic considering i didnt say we're disregarding people, merely curious about others' experience
even_ceo.json,@HunterBridges what would be a reasonable "fair shot"? evaluating what they have on github?
even_ceo.json,@andymangold thanks, this is super helpful
even_ceo.json,@ZackShapiro do you find ridiculous the notion that drive and just learning yourself are at least positively correlated?
even_ceo.json,@andymangold any idea which ones fall into the legit category?
even_ceo.json,@HunterBridges yeah but. opportunity cost.
even_ceo.json,@joeziemer there was a play during the game where they scrambled to change the ball. seemed really odd at the time. and i'm a pats fan.

even_ceo.json,@dsmpowered we being Even, not Silicon Valley.
even_ceo.json,@dsmpowered I agree that the statement is sad, not that it is accurate. But I do genuinely understand your pessimism. We have a lot to prove
even_ceo.json,@dsmpowered I agree.

even_ceo.json,@cfarivar your assumption that the content would be about one company is false. but thank you for your feedback.

even_ceo.json,@susie_c by the way, point well taken re: oakland natives being born here.
even_ceo.json,@jacksonwest we do need the reminder, every day of every week. so thanks :) but definitely aware of vulnerability. is why we're doing this.
even_ceo.json,@susie_c that's fine.
even_ceo.json,@jacksonwest we've got a new document that'll be on the website soon called "Everything you should know about Even" that explains all this:)
even_ceo.json,@susie_c whatever, profiteering is evil in my book. would you be interested in a conversation in person? over coffee maybe?
even_ceo.json,@susie_c for-profit corporations are also vehicles for some pretty awful things, but those two facts are not mutually exclusive
even_ceo.json,@susie_c it's a pretty sad statement on silicon valley that your default position is that we are evil &amp; only interested in exploitation. :(
even_ceo.json,@susie_c what question have i evaded?
even_ceo.json,@susie_c making a profit and making an unfair profit aren't remotely the same, &amp; for-profit corporations are the primary vehicle of progress
even_ceo.json,@JarenGlover of course! jon at http://t.co/dFCWPvtd9S
even_ceo.json,@susie_c  i must admit, i am impressed by your conviction given the lack of data &amp; qualitative information you have about what we're doing
even_ceo.json,@susie_c @jlev in what way are we profiteering?
even_ceo.json,@jlev in what way is it exploitive to offer a product that helps people? also, what is the number of years you would be okay with?
even_ceo.json,@susie_c @jlev what are the many other issues?

even_ceo.json,@z @quicklywilliam I deserve this :(
even_ceo.json,@z @quicklywilliam to be fair tho this gets us uncomfortably close to a discussion about what design really is
even_ceo.json,@z @quicklywilliam for instance what you say how you say it and how often you repeat it is 1000x more important
even_ceo.json,@z @quicklywilliam I think that is true in certain markets. And even then good design is a small piece of the pragmatic  brand puzzle
even_ceo.json,@quicklywilliam i disagree with that actually, i think uber knows exactly what it is doing
even_ceo.json,@quicklywilliam or just not understanding the problem well enough
even_ceo.json,@quicklywilliam the problem is almost never design

even_ceo.json,@andymangold so you hate me but you're good at typography and things? you can say mean things to me while you're helping i guess
even_ceo.json,hi i'm bad at design stuff. would one of you that doesnt hate me and is good at typography and things be interested in helping with a thing?
even_ceo.json,@andrewmbenton hey andrew, wanna grab coffee and talk about no password stuff? we're working on something you might like @knocktounlock
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam sure, jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@alexgriendling i'm not very good at graphic design tho, which is probably why that doesnt piss me off.
even_ceo.json,@alexgriendling shrug. ive always thought of design as one tool in a very full toolbox for solving problems. could be wrong tho.
even_ceo.json,@alexgriendling maybe people are talking about design as the umbrella under which graphic design sits in the comfortable shade?
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam goin well man, got some exciting news comin soon.

even_ceo.json,@tophbrown neither. the only thing i actually care about is the blatant ripoff of our onboarding UX
even_ceo.json,@hipolabs @quicklywilliam well, if that's your position, we'll fix the interference issues by adding your functionality and giving it away.
even_ceo.json,@hipolabs @quicklywilliam so you're saying you didn't copy pretty much everything?
even_ceo.json,so, @hipolabs flat out stole the design of @knocktounlock for scribe. should we just add their functionality to knock? would take ~10 min
even_ceo.json,@wr ; )
even_ceo.json,@andymangold imagine if you had to design the furniture out of building blocks in order to buy anything. that would be pretty cool actually.
even_ceo.json,@andymangold i like where your head's at but is this really a parallel analogy?

even_ceo.json,Facebook: where sometimes your ads perform like total shit and there's zero explanation why
even_ceo.json,@smcbride so someone gave blunt, critical feedback?
even_ceo.json,@smcbride it's different, i'll give you that. but a dude much smarter than me once said "don't try to be different. just try to be good."
even_ceo.json,@smcbride but the page is bad. and i'd bet a lot of money your metrics will prove that.
even_ceo.json,@smcbride if you're genuinely interested i'd be happy to provide constructive feedback.
even_ceo.json,@smcbride it's dickish in 140 chars, for sure. but clearly someone needed to be "dickish" during the process and it never happened
even_ceo.json,@smcbride i mean, you can label it however you'd like, but that's what happened and the results kind of speak for themselves.
even_ceo.json,@smcbride but i rofl because that site drips of corporate groupthink. should just let talented people like you do their own thing
even_ceo.json,@smcbride granted that is incredibly hard to do. probably the hardest part of making good things. especially w/ corporate oversight
even_ceo.json,@smcbride i dunno what the design process is, but it should include don't release things that are bad even when people work their assess off
even_ceo.json,@smcbride do you think it is good?
even_ceo.json,@smcbride dude i have no idea what is going on on that page

even_ceo.json,@mootcycle hmm. lemme ask Will and get back to you.
even_ceo.json,@mootcycle i realize that's a pain, btw. but 4gb of text is an enormous amount of text, i seriously doubt logs are the only issue
even_ceo.json,@mootcycle you can always delete the logs if you'd like. Option-click on the Knock icon and go to Logs Folder
even_ceo.json,@mootcycle 4gb? holy crap. that's not normal
even_ceo.json,@SirPemberton when u eat it?
even_ceo.json,@mootcycle we did, yeah. all that info is helpful, believe it or not. we'll turn it off once the build stabilizes
even_ceo.json,@burnflare yes.
even_ceo.json,@freddielm Knock doesn't create a lock screen. To prevent your computer from locking when it goes to sleep, go to preferences &gt; security
even_ceo.json,@mootcycle this is a pretty dope idea. thanks!

even_ceo.json,@Keir well that's no good. would you like some help figuring out what's going on?
even_ceo.json,@bamcpherson  it does, but the issue you're running into is likely due to nasty iOS7 bluetooth bug, which we're fixing in new iOS version

even_ceo.json,@memo it's kind of messed up actually. i went and looked at it after u messaged me. :(
even_ceo.json,@kennytony yeah, id say it works 99% of the time for me. we're still trying to reproduce the issues it seems you're running into
even_ceo.json,@memo hahaha god that sucks
even_ceo.json,@ashishgandhi_ :-D maps are the best.
even_ceo.json,@ashishgandhi_ tradeoffs, my friend, tradeoffs. if we were to make that easier, we'd have to make something else harder : - )

even_ceo.json,@irondavy this atm card doesnt seem handcrafted at all :(((((
even_ceo.json,@oscarjohanssoon hmm, that is quite weird. can you shoot an email to help@knocktounlock.com with urgent in the subject line?
even_ceo.json,@oscarjohanssoon what happens when you try to set up Knock?

even_ceo.json,@FinTheOfficial awesome. shoot me an email: jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@FinTheOfficial ahh, well that sucks. would you be up for testing a development build of the Mac app which we think corrects that issue?
even_ceo.json,@estoldt yes :)
even_ceo.json,@TechWraith @knocktounlock Hey Daniel, can you do me a huuuuge favor? Shoot me a quick email: jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@markleppke yeah, i just don't understand why all forms of it are inherently bad. i guess i dont see it as black &amp; white
even_ceo.json,@bnystedt Nope, don't need to launch the app. It will keep itself running.
even_ceo.json,RT @anujkdhawan: if only life were as simple and as beautiful as this @knocktounlock
even_ceo.json,@bnystedt you don't have to unlock your phone or open the app.
even_ceo.json,@pmod @knocktounlock thanks peter, very much appreciate it. help@knocktounlock.com‚Äîput urgent somewhere in the email
even_ceo.json,@pmod @knocktounlock well, that's not right (or acceptable). would you mind sending us logs?
even_ceo.json,@pmod @knocktounlock hmm, could be. are you finding knock unreliable?
even_ceo.json,@markleppke out of curiosity, why is that interaction bad? the overly pejorative name notwithstanding
even_ceo.json,@SimonJGreen https://t.co/SNf3ThwjbQ :)
even_ceo.json,@shawin jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@shawin huh, very weird. my hunch is this is just a coincidence and knock isn't the culprit, but shoot me an email and we'll figure this out
even_ceo.json,@shawin hmm, is it happening every time?
even_ceo.json,@shawin ahhh, creepy! there is an OS X bug where sometimes the lid is closed but the mac ain't actually asleep :(
even_ceo.json,@GuyWritesCode @knocktounlock Apple's bluetooth stack is the problem. Bugs make everything approximately 1000x harder than it should be
even_ceo.json,@GuyWritesCode @knocktounlock So, no hard timeline yet, but we're working hard on it. Soon :)
even_ceo.json,@GuyWritesCode @knocktounlock It's actually surprisingly difficult to make it work as reliably as we'd need it to before shipping.
even_ceo.json,@i4_1 @knocktounlock Suggestions for how we could be clearer?
even_ceo.json,@jaydisc not externally, no. but something we may do on the help center we have launching tomorrow.
even_ceo.json,@jaydisc agree 100%. we've never seen that before, but looking into and fixing immediately.
even_ceo.json,@izenmike of course. let me know if you run into any more issues :)
even_ceo.json,@izenmike hey Mike, did you get an email about a new version of the Mac app? http://t.co/HoENgqopG2

even_ceo.json,@aurelienche for now, this one seems to work well for people http://t.co/8JakYO4H5w
even_ceo.json,@aurelienche we might officially support a dongle or two in the future.
even_ceo.json,@smithjw hey james‚Äî why the regret? is Knock not working?
even_ceo.json,@tadywankenobi well, we appreciate the feedback either way. :) look forward to you getting to use it :)
even_ceo.json,@aurelienche hmmm. dongles are pretty unreliable, which is why we don't support them officially. which dongle are you using?
even_ceo.json,@tadywankenobi where? on the app store? or our website?
even_ceo.json,@norton_tim thanks! at least we're topping the list in one direction or another.
even_ceo.json,@tadywankenobi Hmm, that's very strange. Sorry for teasing you : (
even_ceo.json,@aurelienche I'm sorry, I don't quite understand. If Knock is letting you set up, it should work
even_ceo.json,@tadywankenobi ah, there's the problem. 2011 iMac doesn't support bluetooth low energy, so knock won't work : (
even_ceo.json,@tadywankenobi @knocktounlock wussa matta? shoot me an email, jon at knocktounlock dotcom. we'll figure out whats goin on

even_ceo.json,@ljharb http://t.co/HoENgqopG2‚Äî try dat
even_ceo.json,@ljharb hey jordan, hmm, did you not get an email last night about a new build?
even_ceo.json,@dryan @SGgrc hey daniel, happy to answer any security questions/concerns you may have.
even_ceo.json,hey people at this cafe could you quiet it down a bit i'm trying to listen to this new eminem album i'm blasting on this jambox i brought
even_ceo.json,@danielmall haha, no, you should get a new knock development team :) can you shoot me a quick email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@danielmall what the what. your setup is all sorts of messed up. never seen that before. can you try restarting setup?
even_ceo.json,@danielmall which password field? could you possibly screenshot?
even_ceo.json,@andymangold :        -       )
even_ceo.json,@danielmall hey dan, we think we  fixed the issue that you were running into. http://t.co/HoENgqopG2
even_ceo.json,@darrellwhitelaw @knocktounlock Hey Darrell, could you shoot me a quick email? jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@moynihan super glad to hear it :)
even_ceo.json,@moynihan  thanks for sticking with us shaun! we're working hard to fix bugs we honestly just didnt run into at small sample size
even_ceo.json,@kennytony :-)
even_ceo.json,@kennytony you can just delete it out of the applications folder
even_ceo.json,@kennytony tbh it's pretty complicated. much easier to just grab the new version at http://t.co/HoENgqopG2 and be totally sure :)
even_ceo.json,@kennytony Er. I think if you put your cursor on the status bar it will show the hidden ones
even_ceo.json,@sanderdv1 Yep, but both Knock for iPhone and Knock for Mac will automatically update themselves
even_ceo.json,@kennytony Looks like you've got a ton of apps there!. If there are too many to fit, OS X will truncate. But Knock is still running
even_ceo.json,@sanderdv1 id say the adapter doesn't work. Prev versions of knock had a bug that didn't warn incompatibility, but we fixed yesterday
even_ceo.json,@sanderdv1 I honestly dunno. I wouldn't rule it out, but I wouldn't get your hopes up either :( that other adapter does work quite well tho
even_ceo.json,@sanderdv1 ah :( this is why we don't support adapters... They super flaky :(
even_ceo.json,@sanderdv1 is that the adapter you're using?
even_ceo.json,@jaydisc @knocktounlock magic :)
even_ceo.json,@nschaden yeah. it's a tradeoff. i basically couldn't have done that type of presentation without it ;\
even_ceo.json,@nschaden I really dislike a lot of the ways it's (ab)used. But I don't think it's an entirely black and white thing. Could be wrong.
even_ceo.json,@colbyg @RLRae hey colby, sorry it's not working fast enough for you :( can you shoot me a quick email? jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@iamhabitat @knocktounlock ugh, sorry you're running into trouble. can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@jburka &lt;3
even_ceo.json,@nschaden out of curiosity, what's the argument against scroll hijacking? (the inherently negative name notwithstanding)
even_ceo.json,@aweber9 you and your absurdly good view.
even_ceo.json,Turning haters into helpers is maybe the best thing.
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam i did, yep :)
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam in all seriousness, thanks for the moral support. much appreciated.
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam i'm a diva, man. need my beauty rest to do anything worthwhile.
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam i may or may not be crying because of said beer
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam *cry*
even_ceo.json,@matt_mcclure yeah, unfortunately only one Mac right now. multi-mac support coming soon though
even_ceo.json,@tolar @knocktounlock it's taking 20 seconds every time? that aint right. can you shoot me a quick email? jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@haikusages ha, you found him! :)

even_ceo.json,@marcdowie @knocktounlock can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@XusBadia hey jesus, we're a bit overwhelmed tryin to fix bugs right now, but will get back to you soon
even_ceo.json,@retepslluerb @knocktounlock haha you crazy? we barely have time to make the app work :) in all seriousness, using http://t.co/6haTARCBaZ
even_ceo.json,@RyanTHolmes haha, thanks, i think :)
even_ceo.json,@bradlestrange @knocktounlock yep, it will work. good luck putting the ipad in your pocket though :)
even_ceo.json,@bradlestrange @knocktounlock which ipad?
even_ceo.json,@mbarinov soooooon. we want to do it right, which will take some effort
even_ceo.json,@mbarinov soon :)
even_ceo.json,@glassofh2os i meant that there's only so much we can do in the app store, and we really really really wish we could do more :(
even_ceo.json,@glassofh2os yeah, that journey is what i meant by 'hands are tied,' but i can see how that statement sounded like i was being a dick
even_ceo.json,@glassofh2os and as an app store screenshot, and in the app store decription. very open to suggestions on how to be more clear tho :(
even_ceo.json,@glassofh2os i'm sorry you feel we didn't disclose clearly, but i'm not sure what we can do beyond putting it as a huge section on our site
even_ceo.json,@glassofh2os sorry you got burned by it :( you can grab a refund at http://t.co/UwMem50ZYa
even_ceo.json,@glassofh2os I think we need to do a better job of describing the compatible macs in the app store, but honestly our hands are kinda tied
even_ceo.json,@glassofh2os :( out of curiosity, did you download the mac app or the iphone app first?
even_ceo.json,design is not hard. managing your psychology through the design process is the hard part.
even_ceo.json,@logich you're totally right, I'll add it to the faq. honestly the thought just hadn't occurred to me
even_ceo.json,@SamFK sorry you're seeing into trouble. are you running mavericks on your mac, perchance?
even_ceo.json,@matt_mcclure oh snap, howd you do that?
even_ceo.json,@jefforange89 glad to hear it :)
even_ceo.json,@DeMarko soon :)
even_ceo.json,@sigwinch i'd be very happy to discuss further via email if you'd like - jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@sigwinch thank you for your concern. is there something you would like to know?
even_ceo.json,@gaelicWizard bluetooth keyboard
even_ceo.json,@gaelicWizard Not exactly. :) Your Mac is retrieving the password from the OS X secure keychain and quickly typing it.
even_ceo.json,@0100 sorry you're running into trouble :( if it feels buggy, probly cause you're running into a nasty bug we're fixing today.
even_ceo.json,@sigwinch what would you like to know?
even_ceo.json,@kennytony yes of course. Jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@mentalengine we cut that feature just before shipping because it was too unreliable, but if we can improve it then yes definitely
even_ceo.json,@kennytony hm, are you seeing it take a REALLY long time?
even_ceo.json,@matt_mcclure totally agree abt Alfred. We‚Äôre adding a keyboard shortcut to lock in a soonish build as a temp solution
even_ceo.json,@kennytony there is a bug that‚Äôs currently making it slower than it should be. What version of OS X are you on?
even_ceo.json,@Max @quicklywilliam hey Max, sorry you're running into trouble. can you shoot me a quick email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@KADLAC @krislocascio it's also a bug, which we'll have fixed shortly :)

even_ceo.json,@collinhughes @julianbialowas I STOLE YO FACE
even_ceo.json,@shabby173 if you shoot me an email i may be able to help you figure out what's goin on - jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@shabby173 hmm, that aint right. sorry you ran into trouble. :( knock should work with multiple bluetooth connections
even_ceo.json,@rem @brianleroux @joemccann well, it does load a 1080p video ;(
even_ceo.json,@Viper007Bond thanks alex :)
even_ceo.json,@Viper007Bond hey alex‚Äî yeah, sorry, fixing it is super low on the list :(
even_ceo.json,@RabMc1 @knocktounlock no, unfortunately not :(
even_ceo.json,@CodeStars yep, the mac app will automatically update itself when there's a new version.
even_ceo.json,@bobby i like your jokes
even_ceo.json,FastCo nails it. http://t.co/pujZCDnDkD - thanks @thealbumproject
even_ceo.json,@davidgustav You can also quit and relaunch the Mac app to make it update faster.
even_ceo.json,@davidgustav our mothership doesnt have any laser pew pews or tractor beams or anything if it makes you feel any better
even_ceo.json,@w00dyard Not currently, but soon. :)
even_ceo.json,@davidgustav @knocktounlock The app will update itself when the mothership tells it to :)
even_ceo.json,RT @knocktounlock: Trying to use Knock with non-western keyboard layouts and hitting issues? Fear not! We just pushed an update to the Mac ‚Ä¶
even_ceo.json,@benmillett @knocktounlock Yep.
even_ceo.json,@nickheer yep, but you'll also want to delete the app or it will restart it self when you reboot
even_ceo.json,@Authy jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@kaler @knocktounlock if you opt-click on the knock icon in status menu, you'll get access to our fancy logs as well. thanks!
even_ceo.json,@kaler @knocktounlock well, that sucks. sorry you're runnin into trouble. could you maybe shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@coultonvento wuuuuuut. can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@alexgriendling now i'm saying everything in a sean connery accent. thanks.
even_ceo.json,@coultonvento what kind of Mac are you using?
even_ceo.json,@craigcaruso we use it to relaunch the application should it ever crash/get killed for memory. you can use knock without it, if youd like
even_ceo.json,@jennifer thanks jen :)
even_ceo.json,@craigcaruso a jets and yankees fan? ugh, i guess. shoot me an email- jon at knocktounlock dotcalm :)
even_ceo.json,yay, we're the #1 paid app in the app store. thanks for giving us some money, you guys. also, suck it duck dynasty beard app.
even_ceo.json,@kennytony well, that sucks. can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@paulmadsen haha don't even joke about that. i wish so hard that were true.
even_ceo.json,@blackavar officially? no. unofficially? http://t.co/VvZnBVfBKq
even_ceo.json,@paulmadsen whats a loft?
even_ceo.json,@paulmadsen haha, especially considering no one involved in the video is from san francisco, including the beard
even_ceo.json,@jefforange89 http://t.co/9UfgZIIzBO
even_ceo.json,@jefforange89 officially we don't support them, but unofficially, well, :)
even_ceo.json,@Alexio247 no, unfortunately it is not :(
even_ceo.json,@davecowart yeah, we hate that too. caused by a bug we're fixing in the next update
even_ceo.json,@bendywalker yeah, we hate that too. caused by a bug we're fixing in the next update
even_ceo.json,@fabianmu whoa, really? that sucks. can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@iCRCanty ugh, sorry, it's supposed to, but we're running into a bug that we can't reproduce :(
even_ceo.json,@nbashaw thanks buddy :)
even_ceo.json,@vedeht  :)
even_ceo.json,@vedeht @knocktounlock workin on it ;)
even_ceo.json,@samin ah, yes, that's true. we'll automatically end the screensaver when you approach your mac soon.
even_ceo.json,@wrightmartin :( what did you find obnoxious?
even_ceo.json,@MikkelGraulund Hey dude, about to go to sleep, but shoot an email to help@knocktounlock.com and we'll figure out whats goin on
even_ceo.json,@Thejackleonard Yep.
even_ceo.json,@jogloran hm, sure. email me at jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@jogloran sorry you ran into that. if you'd like a refund, we totally understand: http://t.co/fCYU0PbyDz
even_ceo.json,@jogloran right, the bug is that the app shouldn't have launched and should have instead told you your mac was incompatible :(
even_ceo.json,@jogloran sorry you're running into trouble. unfortunately this is a bug we're having trouble reproducing :( what kind of Mac do you have?
even_ceo.json,@arjunphlox not yet, but soon. :)
even_ceo.json,@TheTomCanuck Unfortunately not :(  iOS7 has muuuuch better support for Bluetooth Low Energy.
even_ceo.json,@samin Oh, but it does, good sir. It does.
even_ceo.json,@CodinGuru The app will update itself automatically :)
even_ceo.json,@dunn thanks andy, means a lot.
even_ceo.json,@chickiephi We're working like a bunch of bosses to fix the issues, but I wouldn't wait. Throw em at us, we can take it. :)
even_ceo.json,@ljharb Evidently not :( Can you shoot me an email - jon at knocktounlock dotcalm? Thanks Jordan
even_ceo.json,@ELLIOTTCABLE well, that sucks. sorry you're running into so much trouble :( can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@vishavdubb sorry vishav, drowning in emails over here. will get back to you asap
even_ceo.json,@pencerw After you unlock for the first time, we show you share buttons, figuring it as good a time as any to get you to shill for us :)
even_ceo.json,@pencerw @knocktounlock Our pairing process loads a webview which calls the Facebook and Twitter APIs
even_ceo.json,@TheJackRandall @quicklywilliam @knocktounlock Thanks Jack! We're drowning in emails right now, but will get back to you as soon as we can
even_ceo.json,@AnthonyQuintano WHAT DOES IT MEEEAANN
even_ceo.json,@pipequanta noooo, then i'd have to put pants on and stuff : (
even_ceo.json,@RickMacMerc @knocktounlock Can you send to jon@? Sorry for the delay‚Äî we're drowning in emails over here :)
even_ceo.json,@supernayan @knocktounlock Click the Knock logo in your status bar (on the far right here: http://t.co/SOC8TgGex2) and then click Unlink
even_ceo.json,@RickMacMerc @knocktounlock you could be runnin into a nasty bug. can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@gepeto42 @knocktounlock an unfortunate error. we're currently, using 1024-bit, likely upping to 2048 bit soon
even_ceo.json,@supernayan @knocktounlock not yet, but sooooon :)
even_ceo.json,@roblahblah  @cfohlin thanks rob :)
even_ceo.json,@bunnyhero @knocktounlock hmm, strange. i use a bt mouse, no issues. mind shootin me an email at jon at knocktounlock dotcalm?
even_ceo.json,@vl thanks buddy. Means a lot.
even_ceo.json,@TylerGalpin *smooch*
even_ceo.json,@waywardhem thanks dude, appreciate the persistence :)
even_ceo.json,@waywardhem blah. definitely a bug. can you email me at jon@ knocktounlock dotcalm ?
even_ceo.json,@waywardhem @interlock @knocktounlock no, definitely not. try turning location services off and see if that slows down your battery burn
even_ceo.json,@ghostrocket @knocktounlock thanks buddy :)
even_ceo.json,@ranjanxroy @knocktounlock Yep.
even_ceo.json,@TobyRyan soon, my friend. soon.
even_ceo.json,@ginlane @knocktounlock LUV U
even_ceo.json,@echeverrio soon. :)
even_ceo.json,@ThatOneTommy @knocktounlock haha awesome. i was not expecting the fist, nicely done
even_ceo.json,@bsierakowski @quicklywilliam haha i wish that were true. more like terrible at 5, good enough at 6 : )
even_ceo.json,Now this is tech journalism. Thanks @mashable and @film_girl http://t.co/UOwMvwpKWd
even_ceo.json,@MacBenTosh @knocktounlock hey man, we just want it to work as advertised. we should be thanking you for helping us squash issues.
even_ceo.json,@MacBenTosh @knocktounlock wow, really? yikes. did you have any other apps which use loc serv before knock?
even_ceo.json,@MacBenTosh @knocktounlock hm, that does sound unusual. can you lemme know if you're seeing a drain on the battery?
even_ceo.json,@MacBenTosh @knocktounlock That icon is definitely misleading. We use location services very occasionally, let alone all the time : )
even_ceo.json,@lonelysandwich @quicklywilliam @caleweissman if he's anything like me, he's just jealous of the glory of that beard
even_ceo.json,@verde_io out of curiosity, have you ever seen that transition somewhere else?
even_ceo.json,@imathis It's supposed to, but a nasty bug seems to prevent that for some Mac models. Sorry :( But‚Äî http://t.co/UwMem50ZYa :)
even_ceo.json,@kchau @knocktounlock it very occasionally uses gps to help save battery life and relaunch the app. you can turn it off if you'd like.
even_ceo.json,@garrettmurray @knocktounlock we do indeed :)
even_ceo.json,Now this is some fine journalism http://t.co/sXGf7Gxh8I
even_ceo.json,@echeverrio yeah, sorry about that. we'll be shipping a free upgrade that fixes this soon, but for now just tap a key on your keyboard :(
even_ceo.json,@briannadler @knocktounlock :( http://t.co/fCYU0PbyDz :)
even_ceo.json,@jordanborth @knocktounlock nope, unless you're used to locking with fast user switching, which prevents knock from running :(
even_ceo.json,@paulheyer @knocktounlock nope, we use apple's lock screen. it's kind of surprising that they have so many ways to lock, but there you go.
even_ceo.json,@russianguns we'll be shipping an update to apple which fixes it in just a bit.
even_ceo.json,@russianguns sorry to suggest something so basic‚Äîdidn't mean to offend. i guess you've hit the rarest version of that already rare bug.
even_ceo.json,@danielmall ugh, sorry dan. lemme look into your crashes (we get logs thankfully) and get back to you.
even_ceo.json,@kennytony totally agree. http://t.co/Vra4iN5yzm ‚Äî lemme know if there's anything you think we missed :)
even_ceo.json,@kennytony you'll have to sign into your account once to get your apps to run, but after that, yep.
even_ceo.json,@jaems33 for proof of no hax, i cant seem to get that james teow guy to have dinner with me
even_ceo.json,@kennytony the app will relaunch itself. if you reboot your phone and have a passcode, you'll have to unlock the phone once before knocking
even_ceo.json,@danielmall naw, thats ok. on your Mac, can you try turning bluetooth off and back on?
even_ceo.json,@andrewculver @knocktounlock wait, what? that sounds terrible. can you shoot me an email? jon at knocktounlock dotcalm
even_ceo.json,@galonsky @knocktounlock not exactly, but it's used only very occasionally.
even_ceo.json,@cfohlin @chrismunns @knocktounlock http://t.co/2lYPGbLVNi
even_ceo.json,@bobby i could easily reply to this tweet with that clip but you get the idea.
even_ceo.json,@ethank yeah, there seems to be a bug with the mac app not triggering incompatibility with some models. sorry about that *facepalm*
even_ceo.json,@russianguns Ugh, sry bout that. A suuuuper rare bug we found at the last minute. Try starting the pairing process over and you'll be good
even_ceo.json,@danielmall @knocktounlock Well, poo. Every time? Honestly never seen that before. What kinda Mac you got?
even_ceo.json,@arnab_das http://t.co/2lYPGbLVNi
even_ceo.json,@bobby http://t.co/96Eggu65bx
even_ceo.json,@JudsonCollier @TechCrunch haha, thanks judson. :)
even_ceo.json,Also @gizmodo, who wins for best gif. http://t.co/CcmrImvdfR
even_ceo.json,@robwhitlow3 @knocktounlock Nope, definitely not. No worries about that.
even_ceo.json,Oh hey, @TechCrunch wrote a very nice little thing about us. http://t.co/QKxr3jgtWA
even_ceo.json,@vishavdubb jon at knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@pmod @knocktounlock that build unfortunately does require the screen to be awake. we'll ship another build that fixes this issue soonish
even_ceo.json,@TheLobster2000 no, unfortunately not
even_ceo.json,@pmod @knocktounlock The http://t.co/IlAz6bdPLb one I can't explain though. Facebook's ad network maybe?
even_ceo.json,@pmod @knocktounlock Ok: During the pairing process, we're loading a webview for http://t.co/ve6iesjIMH. That page makes those requests
even_ceo.json,@vishavdubb @knocktounlock the app is available on the app store for $3.99.
even_ceo.json,@galonsky @knocktounlock Apple shows the icon because you've granted permission, but we aren't using it constantly. Definitely confusing :(
even_ceo.json,@sudoloic thanks dude :)
even_ceo.json,@blehnert @knocktounlock thanks, means a lot :)
even_ceo.json,@Manuel_Castillo thanks dude, means a lot.
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam count me in.
even_ceo.json,@jb really? well, that sucks a lot. here's a youtube link: http://t.co/59tzKVtKfL
even_ceo.json,@DesignerDon if by 'my team' you mean my 'all time best beards team,' then yes.
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam too many :)
even_ceo.json,@slothdog it will work on new ipod touches.
even_ceo.json,@MacBenTosh @knocktounlock we do ask for them, because we're doing some things to save battery. but you can refuse and it will still work
even_ceo.json,@LinusEkenstam @knocktounlock hey, thanks dude. really means a lot.
even_ceo.json,@DesignerDon agreed. that was why we cast him.
even_ceo.json,@jonathonmoody sshhhh..... coming soon :)
even_ceo.json,@SirPemberton does that mean it smells like BO
even_ceo.json,@zenwheel :( unfortunately your mac isn't compatible. not sure why app didn't pick that up. head here for a refund: http://t.co/fCYU0PbyDz
even_ceo.json,@lucasbet unfortunately right now we only support linking with one mac, but mutli-mac support coming soonish :)
even_ceo.json,@zenwheel which mac have you got?
even_ceo.json,@gepeto42 you should see shortly some security articles that describe how it works in pretty great detail.
even_ceo.json,@tapbot_paul yep. this one works pretty well: http://t.co/fRiOqP4AvR overall they can be spotty, so we quietly avoid the subject :)
even_ceo.json,@patricksharkey hmm, yikes. can you shoot me an email at jon@ knocktounlock dotcom ?
even_ceo.json,@tapbot_paul unfortunately we don't want people buying the iphone app iftheir  mac is incompatible. DLing mac app first prevents that some
even_ceo.json,@tapbot_paul well, when you put it like that, we seem like total idiots :)
even_ceo.json,@TJ @knocktounlock sshhhhh. coming soon. :)
even_ceo.json,@paulheyer @knocktounlock unfortunately fast user switching completely signs you out of your account, which prevents apps from running  :(
even_ceo.json,@pmod @knocktounlock Hmm, that does seem weird. Lemme check out a few things to see what's going on and get back to you.
even_ceo.json,@foozelz huh, no, that's weird. can you possibly send me a screenshot so I can have a looksee? jon@ knocktounlock dotcom
even_ceo.json,@patricksharkey try putting the phone in your pocket and lemme know if your mind explodes
even_ceo.json,@mithical @knocktounlock unfortunately there really isn't anything we can do :(
even_ceo.json,@ThePeej ugh, that sucks. head here: http://t.co/fCYU0PbyDz
even_ceo.json,@mithical @knocktounlock just treatin folks like we'd want to be treated.
even_ceo.json,@patricksharkey Well, crud. Out of curiosity, 2 questions: 1) what Mac do you have? 2) where is your phone when you knock on it?
even_ceo.json,@mithical @knocktounlock No, unfortunately the 2011 iMac doesn't support Bluetooth 4.0 :(
even_ceo.json,@fabianmu @knocktounlock yeah, sorry about that. we'll push an update to the app soon that fixes this issue.
even_ceo.json,@McCarron no comment :)
even_ceo.json,@kneelshah @knocktounlock thanks neil &lt;3
even_ceo.json,@McCarron there are a few out there that work pretty well, like this one: http://t.co/L8IbpuAelr. but we dont officially support them
even_ceo.json,@ke @quicklywilliam thanks kevin, means a lot.
even_ceo.json,@MichaelAleo great Q. the security nerds call it a signal of intent. aka 'don't auto unlock to something embarrassing when boss is around'
even_ceo.json,@meyerweb :(
even_ceo.json,@jaems33 &lt;3
even_ceo.json,@McCarron oh oh. yeah, sorry about that. is a (terrible) bug we're squashing right now.
even_ceo.json,@mattaningram there's a confirmation, if that's comforting at all : )
even_ceo.json,@mattaningram removes the link. good call tho, it isn't super clear at all.
even_ceo.json,@McCarron @knocktounlock what happens when you click the download button? here's the app store link: https://t.co/pVGVdlssZ4
even_ceo.json,@allardice thanks simon. means a lot.
even_ceo.json,@mattaningram thanks mattan :)

even_ceo.json,@bobby can you just send me the report
even_ceo.json,yay we officially have a company founded in delaware a place i've never been.
even_ceo.json,@alexgriendling :) thanks Alex. was great to meet you.

gusto_company.json,@DanethaDoe @EvanCarmichael @ryzeonline Oh, you know we're *all" about meditation. That's our jam. ;) #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@DanethaDoe @Calendly @suzannemerrett Awwww, thanks! So thrilled you're joining these chats now! :D #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@DanethaDoe @Calendly @suzannemerrett Agreed! Approach these methods like an experiment. Try for 1-2 weeks, see how you feel. #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@Calendly @suzannemerrett An effective tactic may be scheduling hardest tasks early in the morning first, i.e. eating the frog. #dellsmbchat
gusto_company.json,@Calendly @suzannemerrett But often, the only constant at a startup or small business is change. So you have to be flexible. #dellsmbchat
gusto_company.json,@Calendly @suzannemerrett It might really depend on the person, honestly. Some people thrive with more rigid scheduling. #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@EvanCarmichael @SheTroublshoots So true. Helping others can often refresh and lift you up as well. #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@ryzeonline @EvanCarmichael Often, you'll find the task is easier than you originally thought. You'll be proud for starting. #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@ryzeonline @EvanCarmichael Hesitation often comes from fear of what the experience will be like. Let go of expectations. #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@Calendly @EvanCarmichael So true. Don't get paralyzed in the pursuit of perfection. #DellSMBChat
gusto_company.json,@EvanCarmichael @DellSmbCA Better to break it into 3-5 most important tasks you must get done; you'll feel more accomplished! #dellsmbchat
gusto_company.json,@EvanCarmichael @DellSmbCA It's easy to get overwhelmed if your to-do list is a million things every day. #DellSMBChat

headspace_ceo.json,@kamicarriero ...but they are just more thoughts. Once we know inner peace, we don't really mind what kind of thoughts arise in the mind
headspace_ceo.json,@kamicarriero maybe let's re-frame the question, because trying to *stamp out* scarcity thinking suggests it is something inherently bad...
headspace_ceo.json,@kamicarriero the introduction of mindfulness in to many large orgs is a great example of this
headspace_ceo.json,@kamicarriero orgs can provide employees with the tools they need to be happy and well. Good for team, good for org, good for society
headspace_ceo.json,@kamicarriero we don't feel fulfilled because we chase after temporary happiness, rather than discovering our natural sense of contentment
headspace_ceo.json,Biggest obstacle to headspace is wanting things to be different than they are. Resisting thoughts leaves no room for a spacious, calm mind.
headspace_ceo.json,@PauCasasGriera it's a very personal thing, different for every person, but I would listen to music for enjoyment, and meditate for focus

headspace_ceo.json,@jajaranza yeah, his teachings were very good I think, based in a strong tradition and lineage which is always key
headspace_ceo.json,@gabeser yes, without singing along to it, very deliberately try to encourage it, as though you were watching&amp;waiting for it to happen
headspace_ceo.json,@gabeser I think all of the physical senses become heightened after meditation, so being more aware of taste is very normal for sure
headspace_ceo.json,It's tempting to think meditation's about waiting for something to happen, rather than being present for what's actually happening right now

headspace_ceo.json,@meat_storm pleasure. are you using the app or are you free-styling it?
headspace_ceo.json,@hombrebrillante stay with it though and pay more attention to simply being with the process and enjoying taking the time out if you can
headspace_ceo.json,@hombrebrillante yeah,frustrating as it sounds, meditation has nothing to do with goals or results and yet when we let go, they often happen
headspace_ceo.json,Thanks for the great link @Upworthy, but who's the guy in the photo? It's me in the video, but not in the picture :) @TED_TALKS has original

headspace_ceo.json,Yeah, lots of people use the app on their commute. It's a great use of time #timebetterspent @RichardITait
headspace_ceo.json,@odhranallen Sure, download the headspace app, try Take10 for free, and just follow the instructions #simpleasthat
headspace_ceo.json,Try attaching your headspace session to something else you do every day.For example, brush teeth and meditate - helpful for creating routine
headspace_ceo.json,U don't have to get together to do it,or even do it at the same time,but helps commitment if you share the meditation journey with a friend
headspace_ceo.json,Makes sure it gets done, clears the mind for day ahead and plants seed of mindfuless for everything which follows @hombrebrillante

luxe_ceo.json,@denverbrandy in this case, they walk directly to their destination, e.g. restaurant, versus having to walk 3-4 blocks.
luxe_ceo.json,@denverbrandy you know the service includes the cost of parking? It's not just a service for having someone park your car.
luxe_ceo.json,@denverbrandy what about parents with kids/strollers or saving people from walking into a dark unsafe parking lot at night. All true stories
