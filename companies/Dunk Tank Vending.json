Inside this retail store there is going to be a setting of a live person or persons performing everyday activities that us humans do all the time like watching tv, in the office, on the computer, eating, talking on the phone having a conversation reading, dancing, etc.  Under these so called settings there is going to be a huge dunk tank with water.  Customers will be able to go to Dunk Tank Vending and buy their set of play balls to dunk the live person on the setting into the water tank.  There is going to be a dunk tank target for the kids which will be easier and one for adults into where the adult will have to throw the ball to a professional baseball catcher and get a strike to trigger the dunk tank target.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Fun, Funny, Entertaining, Stress Relief", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-26T01:08:08Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/889001-bb2fed2fc9377c93f2f2c4ca3c311d66-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445821599", "company_size": null, "name": "Dunk Tank Vending", "created_at": "2015-10-26T01:06:44Z", "linkedin_url": null, "blog_url": null}
