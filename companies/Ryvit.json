On average, these businesses use at least 10 applications to run their business, with a central focus to the accounting platform.  Because of this, more than 80% of businesses are demanding integration. \n\nRyvit aims to help Vendors solve this problem and disrupt the trends occurring in the application layer of technology by helping Businesses that need integration achieve it.  All of our competition is placing the integration burden on the Businesses themselves, vs. working with the Application Vendors to bring the solutions to the business directly.  Ryvit-enabled Partners will be able to white-label solutions that integrate with the top accounting platforms in their market.  With those solutions in place, our Partners will be able to expand revenue with subscription-based add-on pricing, adding an estimated 20-40% to their top line.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Integration Platform as a Service", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-23T20:06:09Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/887356-f413d47fc58217281094e19407cbaf6c-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445630754", "company_size": null, "name": "Ryvit", "created_at": "2015-10-23T20:06:09Z", "linkedin_url": null, "blog_url": null}
