These products provide the neurologists with critical data that can be useful in diagnosis, monitoring, and assessing therapeutics response. We call our patented blood test panel WINDOW INTO THE BRAIN. \n\nIn 2013, MSDx\u2019s first patent was issued for its WINDOW INTO THE BRAIN technology, describing methods of detecting a neurological condition via analysis of circulating phagocytes. The WINDOW INTO THE BRAIN test panel offers a real-time view of pathological processes and disease activity in the brain. Often referred to as a \u201cnon-invasive brain biopsy,\u201d it includes regulatory, demyelination, neurodegenerative, and leukocyte transmigration biomarkers. MSDx\u2019s assays can be tested individually or as a panel. Though initially focused on Multiple Sclerosis (MS), this technology may be applied to other neurological disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease(PD)..", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Blood Testing Products for Brain Disease", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-26T10:32:45Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/889320-b9c5d253a5dbb17e43cfd8505aa567c7-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445847141", "company_size": null, "name": "MSDx", "created_at": "2015-10-26T08:12:26Z", "linkedin_url": null, "blog_url": null}
