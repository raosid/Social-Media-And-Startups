We are a unique documentary distributor that both creates its own content and distributes acquired content with the intent of reaching audiences around the world through the various digital platforms as well as traditional DVD, Blu-Ray, private and theatrical screenings and the growing educational pipeline. Our library of films operates as a catalogue of intellectual property where we license and sublicense over a dozen rights for each film to generate revenue. Our customers vary from those audience members who are connected directly to the topic of one film in particular or who are part of a growing number of documentary film fans.  Working alongside iTunes, Amazon and Netflix we will offer customers the opportunity to engage in the topics of the films we bring to life in whatever format that suits them best.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Premiere destination for documentary films", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-20T17:24:20Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/883061-84a584fd1c8799912bd398a4de9b42d5-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445361853", "company_size": null, "name": "Life Is My Moive Entertainment", "created_at": "2015-10-20T17:24:20Z", "linkedin_url": null, "blog_url": null}
