We target land parcels of approximately 60 - 100 acres to generate cash flow and appreciation. \n\nThe blend of units will create three revenue streams: sales of single family, rental income from leased properties and sales of the leased properties. New Subdivisions are most valuable in high population growth areas with strong economic outlooks.\n\nEvery year over 150,000 people move to Houston and Dallas. Population growth and other demographic shifts ensure that demand for new homes will grow over time. This has driven home prices upward, tightened the housing supply and outstripped the ability of home builders to build houses fast enough. Homes buyers are young families and other new household formations.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "We develop small residential subdivisions in expanding Texas markets.", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-24T15:46:21Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/887905-3a2b6f9af018dc53499f5556987fee8b-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445699664", "company_size": null, "name": "South East Texas Capital Advisors", "created_at": "2015-10-24T15:14:28Z", "linkedin_url": null, "blog_url": null}
