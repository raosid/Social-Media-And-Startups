This is due to driving increased usage and utility for a brand\u2019s mobile app, ultimately making a brand\u2019s mobile presence more powerful, valuable and content-rich. \n\nThe ability to be consumer intelligent allows smartphones and data to be more precise and timely when sending notifications. Notifications pull the consumer into the app, and the consumer is reminded of the brand\u2019s value through the receipt of brand content. These notification could include messages, videos, offers, photos or links. \n\n\nUse Case: After landing at O\u2019Hare Airport, a consumer receives a notification through United\u2019s app on their mobile device about the best places to shop and eat in Chicago.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Ad-tech plugged-in an, app increasing purchase.", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-20T22:06:52Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/883467-f6dd70c6b8dfe1ceae431d47e62e7a5e-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445378807", "company_size": null, "name": "Digital Factory Inc.
