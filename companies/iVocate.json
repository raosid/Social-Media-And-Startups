But politics makes strange bedfellows, and iVocate wants to make more of them. \n\nMost recent technology has focused on grassroots political activity. While an important piece, it is the professional advocates, like non-profit organizations, trade associations, and in-house and contract government relations professionals, that are primarily responsible for managing advocacy strategy, relationships and activities. Spending on government relations has grown 77% since 1998, and is now a $30b industry.\n\niVocate provides professional advocates with a match.com-like platform for identifying allies and creating coalitions, and research, collaboration and communications tools to make management of coalitions and campaigns easier and more effective.\n\nWe are looking to raise $500,000 by April 2016, and $1 million by December 2016.", "twitter_url": "http://twitter.com/@ivocate", "high_concept": "Match.com for advocacy organizations.", "facebook_url": "", "updated_at": "2015-10-26T19:58:51Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/886036-bc06013d1d727530d66812a61edce67f-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445536689", "company_size": "1-10", "name": "iVocate", "created_at": "2015-10-22T17:58:15Z", "linkedin_url": "", "blog_url": ""}
