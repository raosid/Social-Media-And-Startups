Current screening solutions purposely cut recruiters from the conversation and are very hard to proctor. TechScreen is the industry's only solution that addresses time-to-fill, skills qualification, professional development and corporate branding in a process being driven by the recruiter.\n   TechScreen lets companies begin the technical competency evaluation on the first contact by the recruiter, who becomes more proficient, confident and credible by using our tool to execute their core job function.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Making Recruiters More Technical", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-26T13:50:56Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/887328-cb3646765856e6a7538295e2f738a323-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445629501", "company_size": null, "name": "CoderProxy", "created_at": "2015-10-23T19:45:06Z", "linkedin_url": null, "blog_url": null}
