This app will use Bluetooth to sync multiple smartphones to one 'host' smartphone, therefore playing music simultaneously. There are endless situations I find myself in where I could use this app already. To name a few: A picnic at the park, at the beach, around a campfire, around any table with friends. It also can be used on lakes and rivers, while boats tie up and compete to play the loudest one song, this would allow multiple boats tied up next to each other to play the same song, at the same time by just connecting on the app, then plugging their phones into their boats aux cord. \n\nNot everyone has the money to have a home full of Bluetooth speakers, however more and more people have smartphones in their pocket every single day. \n\nThere are similar apps out there, just not with this functionality. Reviews show it will be a huge hit when perfected.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Smartphones Now Smartspeakers. Link UP.
