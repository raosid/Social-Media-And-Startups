Some 800 million want to learn English.\n\nIn Asia English teaching apps account for $1 Billion in revenue, with the top three countries being China, Korea and Japan\n\nCurrent technology language solutions schedule a student with a teacher online or via Skype for a video conference. The disadvantages to this method is scalability and quality of teachers.\n\nOver the past 12 months we have developed a purely software driven alternative, a multi-lingual Artificial Intelligence Engine that uses Speech Recognition and TTS (Text-to-Speech), to create a similar experience as if it was a real human teacher.\n\nOur software driven approach is scalable and delivers consistent quality teaching at a fraction of the cost of competitors offerings.", "twitter_url": null, "high_concept": "Siri meets Language Learning", "facebook_url": null, "updated_at": "2015-10-20T12:43:43Z", "thumb_url": "https://d1qb2nb5cznatu.cloudfront.net/startups/i/882691-5c8d4a107c2021136b75d50f2eb7fd34-thumb_jpg.jpg?buster=1445344871", "company_size": null, "name": "TWAIN", "created_at": "2015-10-20T12:41:16Z", "linkedin_url": null, "blog_url": null}
